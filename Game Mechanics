1. Core Mechanic: Dialogue-Based Decision-Making
Mechanic Description: The primary mechanic in Layali is dialogue-based decision-making. Players guide Layla through a series of conversations with historical figures, such as priests, scholars, and officials, from various Egyptian eras. Through multiple-choice dialogue trees, the player must make strategic choices that influence Layla’s interactions, allegiances, and the narrative’s outcome.
Justification: This mechanic is fundamental to player agency, directly tying into Zimmerman’s interactive narrative theory. It emphasizes how players interact with the game world by engaging in dialogues that drive the story forward. Dialogue choices affect not just the immediate scene but Layla's fate, shaping relationships and unlocking new story branches based on the player's decisions.
Example: Similar mechanics are used in games like Mass Effect, where the player's dialogue choices deeply impact story outcomes, creating a personalized narrative experience. In Layali, this mechanic reinforces the theme of player agency by making Layla’s path dependent on how well the player navigates complex conversations and historical dilemmas.

2. Secondary Mechanic: Procedural Puzzles
Mechanic Description: The secondary mechanic is procedural puzzles. In each era that Layla visits, she encounters culturally specific puzzles that represent the knowledge of that time. Solving these puzzles allows Layla to progress through the story by unlocking artifacts, translating ancient scripts, or bypassing obstacles in the environment. These puzzles require logic and pattern recognition, with each solved puzzle giving the player access to deeper historical secrets.
Justification: This mechanic supports Bogost's procedural rhetoric, illustrating how players can learn and apply historical wisdom to solve modern problems. The puzzles emphasize the importance of learning from the past, mirroring the game's theme of reconciling historical knowledge with present-day challenges.
Example: Games like The Witness use procedural puzzles to teach players how to solve increasingly complex challenges, with each solution representing an understanding of the game world’s underlying logic. In Layali, the puzzles function similarly, offering players a cognitive challenge while reinforcing the cultural and historical narrative of the game.
